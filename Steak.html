    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality.</p> 
        <p>You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak –</p> 
        <p>Seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>2 lbs New York Strip Steaks (2 steaks)</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil (or any high heat cooking oil like canola or extra light olive oil)</li> 
        <li>1 1/2 tsp sea salt </li> 
        <li>1 tsp black pepper (freshly ground)</li> 
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li> 
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp Garlic paste</li> 
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol><li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
        <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li></ol>
